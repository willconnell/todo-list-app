# To Do List App

This is a to-do list web application that I made with React JS, and styled with Bootstrap as well as some custom CSS. It served as my first real practice project with ReactJS, and I learned a great deal about the framework building this. The application is similar in structure to a tutorial that I previously followed, which I will link below.
